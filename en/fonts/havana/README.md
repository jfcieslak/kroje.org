    desc: “Havana” font i inspired by Warsaw neon signs from before 1989. Just like the lettering of that period, the “Havava” design is detail oriented, coherent and sophisticated. Some letters are directly drawn from specific signs – letters “K” and “m” from “Kosmetyki” or letter “t”  from “Mister” sign. The font’s name itself refers to a former cafe “Havana” in Warsaw.
