    desc: “Cyrulik” is inspired by technical stencil lettering found on electrical and mechanical devices in Warsaw, and a prewar headline display font “Cyklop” used in a newspaper called “Cyrulik Warszawski”. The font design combines a strong and sturdy form with delicate and modern details, reflecting the contemporary character of Warsaw.
