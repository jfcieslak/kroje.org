Just like the lettering of that period, the “Havava” design is detail oriented, coherent and sophisticated. Some letters are directly drawn from specific signs – letters “K” and “m” from “Kosmetyki” or letter “t”  from “Mister” sign. The font’s name itself refers to a former cafe “Havana” in Warsaw.","styles":[{"name":"Regular","font":"Havana-Regular"}],"covers":[{"link":"/static/images/font-covers/wk-33.svg","color":"#474A58"},{"link":"/static/images/font-covers/wk-32.svg","color":"#474A58"},{"link":"/static/images/font-covers/wk-34.svg","color":"#474A58"}]},"author":{"name":"Joanna Angulska","photo":"/static/images/authors/ja.jpg","desc":"Graduated from the Graphic and Communication Design Dept. on Poznań Fine Arts University.
